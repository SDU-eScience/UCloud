title: "Disable copy & paste in interactive applications"

description: >
  This option will turn off copy & paste in interactive applications. This is 
  implemented by forcing access to all interactive applications to be done 
  through a remote desktop. This option is insufficient if Internet access 
  is allowed. Copy & paste will still be possible internally in the 
  application, if supported, but it will not be available on the client 
  machine.
  
  This feature will automatically disable the "Open terminal" feature on all
  jobs.

      If enabled, copy & paste will be turned off. If not enabled, 
      copy & paste will be available if the application supports it.
