Some notes, I haven't updated any of the scripts. We probably cannot do super reliable cross compilation and might
need to do compilation per platform.

In that case, something along the lines of this will do it:

docker build \
    --push \
    --tag dreg.cloud.sdu.dk/ucloud-dev/integration-module-amd64:2025.4.127 \
    .
docker buildx imagetools create -t dreg.cloud.sdu.dk/ucloud-dev/integration-module:2025.4.127 \
    dreg.cloud.sdu.dk/ucloud-dev/integration-module-amd64:2025.4.127 \
    dreg.cloud.sdu.dk/ucloud-dev/integration-module:2025.4.125

The idea is that we build a different image (with the arch being in the image name).

Repeat for all platforms that need it.
