# Built-in Applications

This chapter will cover how to use and configure the built-in applications which UCloud offers for Slurm-based
providers. This chapter assumes familiarity with how applications work. Refer to [this](./app-management.md) for more
details. The built-in applications are optional and can be skipped if they are not a good fit for a given provider.

## Enabling the Repository

- Instructions on how to enable the UCloud repository
- What it will do to your application management interface
- How to test the applications and how to make them publicly available
- Something about prerequsites and on which platforms we test these applications

## Structure of Applications

- What will this do to your HPC system?
- How are applications built and loaded?

## Customizing Applications

- How to change the applications to fit into the system
- How to enable/disable individual applications


It should be possible to customize the following:

- Preamble and postamble: These should be adjustable both at a global level and at an individual level
- Names of modules: It should be possible to adjust the names of modules, by providing override configuration
