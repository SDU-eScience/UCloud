# User and Project Management

In this article, we will go through how UCloud/IM interfaces with the user and project systems on your HPC system. We
will also cover different integrations and how managed and unmanaged integrations differ.

## User Mapping

In this section we will cover the purpose of user mappings. We will cover the process from the end-user perspective and
how it differs between managed and unmanaged. We will talk about how OpenID connect can be used.
