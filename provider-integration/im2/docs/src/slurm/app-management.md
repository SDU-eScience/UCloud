# Application management

Ideas:

- Providers should be able to create their own custom applications
- Providers might need to have their own separate catalog
- Users might need to be able to create their own applications
- Providers could benefit from subscribing to a catalog of native apps that we create
- Providers could benefit from being able to download and build apps in a pre-submission step
  (see udocker implementation)
- Our support team could benefit from a better way of creating applications
