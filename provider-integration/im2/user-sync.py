# NOTE(Dan): A janky script for user-synchronization between docker containers (and really, only the setup we have).
# Does it work? Sure! Does it make a lot of assumptions? Absolutely!
#
# Things we could be improved, but probably don't need to:
# - Half-written files. Right now we just write directly to the output files (/etc/{passwd,group,shadow}). We should
#   instead write to a temporary file and then atomically replace it.
# - Bad assumptions about the base of the file remaining immutable
#   - Using the length of a string to remove the base. This fails badly if something is removed.
#   - Not synchronizing changes in lines of the base. This fails badly if, for example, an existing group is changed.
