    """A `Job` in UCloud is the core abstraction used to describe a unit of computation.

They provide users a way to run their computations through a workflow similar to their own workstations but scaling to
much bigger and more machines. In a simplified view, a $TYPE_REF Job describes the following information:

- The `Application` which the provider should/is/has run (see [app-store](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/appstore/apps.md))
- The [input parameters]($TYPE_REF_LINK dk.sdu.cloud.app.store.api.ApplicationParameter) required by a `Job`
- A reference to the appropriate [compute infrastructure]($TYPE_REF_LINK dk.sdu.cloud.accounting.api.Product), this
  includes a reference to the _provider_

A `Job` is started by a user request containing the `specification` of a $TYPE_REF Job. This information is verified by the UCloud
orchestrator and passed to the provider referenced by the $TYPE_REF Job itself. Assuming that the provider accepts this
information, the $TYPE_REF Job is placed in its initial state, `IN_QUEUE`. You can read more about the requirements of the
compute environment and how to launch the software
correctly [here](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/providers/jobs/ingoing.md).

At this point, the provider has acted on this information by placing the $TYPE_REF Job in its own equivalent of
a job queue. Once the provider realizes that the $TYPE_REF Job is running, it will contact UCloud and place the 
$TYPE_REF Job in the `RUNNING` state. This indicates to UCloud that log files can be retrieved and that interactive
interfaces (`VNC`/`WEB`) are available.

Once the `Application` terminates at the provider, the provider will update the state to `SUCCESS`. A $TYPE_REF Job has
terminated successfully if no internal error occurred in UCloud and in the provider. This means that a $TYPE_REF Job whose
software returns with a non-zero exit code is still considered successful. A $TYPE_REF Job might, for example, be placed
in `FAILURE` if the `Application` crashed due to a hardware/scheduler failure. Both `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` are terminal
state. Any $TYPE_REF Job which is in a terminal state can no longer receive any updates or change its state.

At any point after the user submits the $TYPE_REF Job, they may request cancellation of the $TYPE_REF Job. This will
stop the $TYPE_REF Job, delete any
[ephemeral resources](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/providers/jobs/ingoing.md#ephemeral-resources) and release
any [bound resources](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/providers/jobs/ingoing.md#resources).""", importance = 500

Jobs in UCloud are the core abstraction used to describe units of computation.

${Resources.readMeFirst}

The compute system allows for a variety of computational workloads to run on UCloud. All compute jobs
in UCloud run an [application](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/appstore/apps.md) on one or more
['nodes']($TYPE_REF_LINK dk.sdu.cloud.accounting.api.Product.Compute). The type of applications determine
what the job does:
 
- __Batch__ applications provide support for long running computational workloads (typically containerized)
- __Web__ applications provide support for applications which expose a graphical web-interface
- __VNC__ applications provide support for interactive remote desktop workloads
- __Virtual machine__ applications provide support for more advanced workloads which aren't easily
  containerized or require special privileges

Every $TYPE_REF Job is created from a [`specification`]($TYPE_REF_LINK JobSpecification). The specification
contains [input parameters]($TYPE_REF_LINK dk.sdu.cloud.app.store.api.ApplicationParameter), such as files
and application flags, and additional resources. Zero or more resources can be connected to an application,
and provide services such as:

- Networking between multiple $TYPE_REF Job s
- [Storage](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/storage/files.md)
- [Public links](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/ingress.md)
- [Public IPs](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/ips.md)
- [Software licenses](/docs/developer-guide/orchestration/compute/license.md)
