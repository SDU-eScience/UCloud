[UCloud Developer Guide](/docs/developer-guide/README.md) / [Core](/docs/developer-guide/core/README.md) / [Monitoring, Alerting and Procedures](/docs/developer-guide/core/monitoring/README.md) / Third-Party Dependencies (Risk Assessment)
# Third-Party Dependencies (Risk Assessment)

In this document we cover the core 3rd party dependencies we have in UCloud and assess risk based on the following
factors:

- How essential is the dependency for UCloud?
  - __Scale:__ 1 (low) - 5 (high)
- How essential is knowledge of the system to develop UCloud (while keeping it stable and secure)?
  - __Scale:__ 1 (low) - 5 (high)
  - The assessment will include if the knowledge is only essential for a single component or system-wide
- Difficulty of migrating to an alternative technology
  - __Scale:__ 1 (low) - 5 (high)
- Likelihood of the dependency getting discontinued in the coming 5 years
  - __Scale:__ 1 (low) - 5 (high)

We consider a 3rd party dependency to be anything not created by the SDU eScience Center, examples include:

- Software library
- Tool
- Hosted software (e.g. a database server)
- Technical specifications

We use the following format:

## Backend

### Kotlin

- __Website:__ https://kotlinlang.org/

- __Short description:__ Coroutine support library for Kotlin. Used by large chunks of UCloud for all threading needs. 
  Ktor also depends on this library.
- __Described in:__ Indirectly in the following documents: [Structure of a micro-service](./microservice_structure.md),

`kotlinx.coroutines` is listed as an 
[official JetBrains product](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub) making it roughly as
reliable as the Kotlin programming language itself.

- __Likelihood of the dependency getting discontinued in the coming 5 years:__ 1

Ktor is listed as an [official JetBrains product](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)
making it roughly as reliable as the Kotlin programming language itself.

Migration is a fairly straight-forward process since most of the code is wrapped by UCloud code. Business logic would
most likely not be significantly affected by the migration.

Redis is the most popular key-value database.

Most of the code in UCloud never interfaces directly with Redis. All micro-services of UCloud should instead interface
with the abstractions provided by `service-lib`. This makes significant knowledge of redis mostly irrelevant.
