# `GrantsV2.Browse.Request`

_The base type for requesting paginated content._

```kotlin
data class Request(
    val itemsPerPage: Int?,
    val next: String?,
    val consistency: PaginationRequestV2Consistency?,
    val itemsToSkip: Long?,
    val filter: GrantApplicationFilter?,
    val includeIngoingApplications: Boolean?,
    val includeOutgoingApplications: Boolean?,
)
```
Paginated content can be requested with one of the following `consistency` guarantees, this greatly changes the
semantics of the call:

| Consistency | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `PREFER` | Consistency is preferred but not required. An inconsistent snapshot might be returned. |
| `REQUIRE` | Consistency is required. A request will fail if consistency is no longer guaranteed. |

The `consistency` refers to if collecting all the results via the pagination API are _consistent_. We consider the
results to be consistent if it contains a complete view at some point in time. In practice this means that the results
must contain all the items, in the correct order and without duplicates.

If you use the `PREFER` consistency then you may receive in-complete results that might appear out-of-order and can
contain duplicate items. UCloud will still attempt to serve a snapshot which appears mostly consistent. This is helpful
for user-interfaces which do not strictly depend on consistency but would still prefer something which is mostly
consistent.

The results might become inconsistent if the client either takes too long, or a service instance goes down while
fetching the results. UCloud attempts to keep each `next` token alive for at least one minute before invalidating it.
This does not mean that a client must collect all results within a minute but rather that they must fetch the next page
within a minute of the last page. If this is not feasible and consistency is not required then `PREFER` should be used.

---

__üìù NOTE:__ Services are allowed to ignore extra criteria of the request if the `next` token is supplied. This is
needed in order to provide a consistent view of the results. Clients _should_ provide the same criterion as they
paginate through the results.
